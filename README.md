Module 10 Challenge

GRADERS: Please ignore the "Starter code 2" folder. I am not sure why it's there, it wasn't popping up in my Visual Studio code and it doesn't show the completed assignment. It also displays blank jupyter files, you're welcom to open it up but it is NOT my completed work..

All complete work is found in my SurfsUp folder.

All code was derived from Module 10 and Bills meetings.

Please reach out if you can't open something up. 
Thank you
